      <description>I am a graduate student in Kevin Wright&amp;rsquo;s lab at the Vollum Institute at Oregon Health &amp;amp; Science University. My primary research interests are mammalian sensory nervous system development and patterning.
I completed my undergraduate degree in Biology as a member of the Smittcamp Family Honors College at California State University, Fresno. While at Fresno State I worked with Dr. David Lent researching the role of the central complex in invertebrate spatial learning and memory.</description>

      <description>Change in GDP per Capita graph brief This is a brief describing the graph created from the gapminder dataset. It is available as a CRAN Package by installing gapminder and calling library(gapminder) during setup.
Load required libraries To make this graph I used the tidyverse, gapminder, and wesanderson libraries.
library(tidyverse) library(gapminder) library(wesanderson)  Cleaning up the gapminder data The gapminder dataset is gigantic and because for this plot I was only interested in the 1952 and 2007 data I filtered for only that data.</description>

      <description>Along with Ford Prefect, Dent barely escapes the Earth&amp;rsquo;s destruction as it is demolished to make way for a hyperspace bypass. Arthur spends the next several years, still wearing his dressing gown, helplessly launched from crisis to crisis while trying to straighten out his lifestyle.
 He rather enjoys tea, but seems to have trouble obtaining it in the far reaches of the galaxy.
 In time, he learns how to fly and carves a niche for himself as a sandwich-maker.</description>

      <description>In this theme, it is possible to add sections like a Projects one for example. You can add plenty of articles about your projects and a presentation page that will be displayed before the list. All is modulable, if you don&amp;rsquo;t want something.
A Hollywood-funded film version, produced and filmed in the UK, was released in April 2005, and radio adaptations of the third, fourth, and fifth novels were broadcast from 2004 to 2005.</description>

      <description>Introduction This tutorial will show you how to create a simple theme in Hugo. I assume that you are familiar with HTML, the bash command line, and that you are comfortable using Markdown to format content. I&amp;rsquo;ll explain how Hugo uses templates and how you can organize your templates to create a theme. I won&amp;rsquo;t cover using CSS to style your theme.
We&amp;rsquo;ll start with creating a new site with a very basic template.</description>

      <description>Hugo uses the excellent go html/template library for its template engine. It is an extremely lightweight engine that provides a very small amount of logic. In our experience that it is just the right amount of logic to be able to create a good static website. If you have used other template systems from different languages or frameworks you will find a lot of similarities in go templates.
This document is a brief primer on using go templates.</description>
