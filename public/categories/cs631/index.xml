      <description>Change in GDP per Capita graph brief This is a brief describing the graph created from the gapminder dataset. It is available as a CRAN Package by installing gapminder and calling library(gapminder) during setup.
Load required libraries To make this graph I used the tidyverse, gapminder, and wesanderson libraries.
library(tidyverse) library(gapminder) library(wesanderson)  Cleaning up the gapminder data The gapminder dataset is gigantic and because for this plot I was only interested in the 1952 and 2007 data I filtered for only that data.</description>
