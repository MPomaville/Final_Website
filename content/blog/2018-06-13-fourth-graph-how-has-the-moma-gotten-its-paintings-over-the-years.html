<p>This graph looks at the number of gifted paintings vs the number of paintings acqired through purchase or exchange by the MOMA grouped by decade.</p>
<div id="type-of-graph" class="section level2">
<h2>Type of Graph</h2>
<p>This graph is a stacked column graph.</p>
</div>
<div id="the-data" class="section level2">
<h2>The Data</h2>
<p>This data came from a pre-cleaned version of the Museum of Museum Art data set generated by www.fivethirtyeight.com. It was cleaned by Alison Hill and further modified by Matt Pomaville. It is available <a href="%22https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Dystroglycan1234/Data-Vis-Class/master/artworks-cleaned.csv%22">here</a>.</p>
<p>This dataset has a lot of information but I am particularly interested in two columns:</p>
<ul>
<li>year_acquired - The year the MOMA got the painting</li>
<li>gift - A binary value (TRUE or FALSE) indicating if the painting was a gift or a prchase/exchange.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="audience" class="section level2">
<h2>Audience</h2>
<p>This graph is meant for anyone interested in the art at the MOMA in New York. It is easy to interpret and doesn’t require much background knowledge to understand.</p>
</div>
<div id="what-is-the-graph-showing" class="section level2">
<h2>What is the graph showing?</h2>
<p>This graph shows the number of paintings acquired by the MOMA grouped by decade. The decade columns are split into gift and non-gift paintings. There doesn’t seem to be any trend regarding how paintings are acquired.</p>
</div>
<div id="how-to-read-it" class="section level2">
<h2>How to read it</h2>
<p>Reading a stacked column graph is similar to reading any other column graph. Look for any trend in the y-values as the x-value increases. There are multiple meaningful trends across the x-axis, including noise or no trend.</p>
</div>
<div id="presentation-and-annotation" class="section level2">
<h2>Presentation and Annotation</h2>
<p>There is little annotation in this graph. If there was a particular reason a decade was important above the others an annotation coule be added to denote this.</p>
</div>
<div id="variations" class="section level2">
<h2>Variations</h2>
<p>There are not many alternative graphs that coule be used to show this data in the same format. A boxplot of each decade using the mean of each year as a datapoint could be used to make the same point.</p>
</div>
<div id="methods" class="section level2">
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Call the required libraries: <code>tidyverse</code> and <code>wesanderson</code>.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>library(tidyverse)
library(wesanderson)</code></pre>
<p>Pull the data from github.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>moma &lt;- read_csv(&quot;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Dystroglycan1234/Data-Vis-Class/master/artworks-cleaned.csv&quot;)</code></pre>
<pre><code>## Parsed with column specification:

<p>Summarise the data into three columns:</p>
<ul>
<li>gift - A binary factor showing if the painting was a gift or not.</li>
<li>decade_acquired - the decade the painting was acquired in.</li>
<li>total - The total number of paintings acquired by a given means in a year.</li>
</ul>
<pre class="r"><code>moma_gift &lt;- moma %&gt;%

  summarize(sum(n))

names(moma_gift) &lt;- c(&quot;gift&quot;, &quot;decade_acquired&quot;, &quot;total&quot;)</code></pre>
<p>Graph the data as a column graph with year on the x-axis, number acquired on the y-axis, and the stacked columns colored by whether or not the painting was a gift.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>gift_plot_bydecade &lt;- ggplot(moma_gift, aes(x = decade_acquired, y = total)) +
