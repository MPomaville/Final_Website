I am a graduate student in [Kevin Wright's lab](http://www.ohsu.edu/xd/research/centers-institutes/vollum/faculty/kevin-wright.cfm) at the Vollum Institute at Oregon Health & Science University. My primary research interests are mammalian sensory nervous system development and patterning. 

I completed my undergraduate degree in Biology as a member of the Smittcamp Family Honors College at California State University, Fresno. While at Fresno State I worked with Dr. David Lent researching the role of the central complex in invertebrate spatial learning and memory. I have always been interested in questions about our brain and nerves, and that has led me to pursue a Ph.D. in Cellular and Developmental Biology at OHSU.

Outside of science I enjoy hiking in the Cascades, skiing on Mt. Hood, tabletop RPGs, tinkering with various electronics projects, and exploring the ever expanding Portland Craft Beer scene.
